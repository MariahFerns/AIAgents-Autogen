This app helps you automate stock market research using AI agents.
These agents scrape the web and perform research on sites like Yahoo Finance and Google news websites to fetch you the latest updates regarding a particular stock. The agents automatically use Sentiment analysis 
to understand the current market trends.
The report gives you a quick gist of important information without you having to spend hours to put together the same information from multiple sources and websites.
